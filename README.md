## Project Files

### 1. `Finance_Project.py`
This script handles data extraction, processing, and visualization.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Loading**:

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removes duplicates, fills missing values, and standardizes formats.

- **Expense Categorization**:
  - Groups transactions into predefined financial categories.

- **Trend Visualization**:
  - Uses Matplotlib to plot monthly expenditure trends.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('all_banks')

# Summarize expenses by category
expense_summary = data.groupby('Category')['Amount'].sum()

# Plot results
expense_summary.plot(kind='bar', title='Expenses by Category')
plt.show()
```
